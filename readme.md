# Neighborhood Library
#### Welcome to the Neighborhood Library project! This Java-based application allows users to interact with a library's inventory. Users can view available books, check out books, and return them when finished. The system tracks which books are checked out and to whom.

One interesting piece of code in this project is the method for handling user input. In the previous workshop I felt nervous about adding InputmismatchException but this time around I pushed that aside and gave it a shot, I am happy with the way it turned out, and it gave a nice sense of polish to not see red errors when I put letters for an input.
